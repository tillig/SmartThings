# SmartThings

This is a repo where I store my personal SmartThings app code. At some point I may delete it since the prevailing pattern is to commit to a fork of the SmartThingsPublic repo, ostensibly to make it easier to submit for larger inclusion, but I want to be able to keep things separate for now and be more mindful about what I'm contributing vs. what I'm just messing around with.
